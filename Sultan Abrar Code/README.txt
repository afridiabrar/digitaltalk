X. When i saw the code btw it was nice.We need to use some methadology for more better code.
1) Use psr2 Concept
2) Use Snake/Camel Case i saw there is many thing miss on there.
3) We we use repositry pattern try this it would be more beneficial for us.
4) Don't use message response on controller make a separate file for that on resources->lang->en->responseMessages.
5) Use Static method for statuses
6) Use Try Catch
7) Use transaction queries (DB::transaction)
8) Use proper repository pattern.I saw in codes lines that you are using direct elouqent as well.
9) Improvise naming convention.


That's all from my side. Sorry for not checking that much but i tried from my side.
